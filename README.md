- Python tutorial via actually using Python to do things

1. Reading in a file, doing something with the read-in content, and then writing a new file with the modified content
    - Files: `normalize_reviews.py`, `reviews.txt`
    - Each line of `reviews.txt` contains a review of a video game.
    - Task: Read in each line from `reviews.txt`, lower-case it, then write it to a new file named `reviews_normalized.txt`.
    - Run the Python script with: `python normalize_reviews.py` (after it's been modified by filling in the parts indicated by comments)
